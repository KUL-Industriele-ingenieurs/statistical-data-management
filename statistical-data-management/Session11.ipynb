    "\n",
    "In *the American Heart Association Conference* (Nov. 2005) study to gauge whether animal-assisted therapy can improve the physiological responses of heart failure patients, 76 heart patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Each patient in group T was visited by a human volunteer accompanied by a trained dog, each participant in group V was visited by a volunteer only, and the patients in group C were not visited at all. The anxiety level of each patient was measured (in points) both before and after the visits. The accompanying table gives summary statistics for the drop in anxiety level of the three groups of patients were compared with the use of analysis of variance. Although an ANOVA table was not provided in the article, sufficient information is given to reconstruct it.\n",

Conduct a Bonferroni analysis to establish confidence intervals of the treatment mean differences and rank the three treatment means. Use an experimentwise error rate of $\\alpha = 0.03$. Interpret the results of the researchers. Look up the relevant t value in the table or use Python below."

    "A university wants to test whether the moment of the day when an exam takes place has an influence on the test results. They assign students at random to one of three groups: an exam in the morning (M), early afternoon (E) or late afternoon (L). Their results are below. Assuming the underlying distribution of exam scores is normal and the variances in the subgroups the same, conduct ANOVA to determine whether or not there is a significant (use $\\alpha = 0.05$) difference between the groups.\n",
