    "\n",
    "In *the American Heart Association Conference* (Nov. 2005) study to gauge whether animal-assisted therapy can improve the physiological responses of heart failure patients, 76 heart patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Each patient in group T was visited by a human volunteer accompanied by a trained dog, each participant in group V was visited by a volunteer only, and the patients in group C were not visited at all. The anxiety level of each patient was measured (in points) both before and after the visits. The accompanying table gives summary statistics for the drop in anxiety level of the three groups of patients were compared with the use of analysis of variance. Although an ANOVA table was not provided in the article, sufficient information is given to reconstruct it.\n",

We want to analyse whether there is a significant difference between how coaches mark groups. Assuming the underlying distribution of scores is normal and coaches grade with the same variance, conduct ANOVA to determine whether or not there is a significant (use $\\alpha = 0.05$) difference between the group scores.\n",
