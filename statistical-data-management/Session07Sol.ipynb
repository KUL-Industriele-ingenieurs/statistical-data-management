    "When attempting to score a goal in soccer, where should you aim your shot? Should you aim for a goalpost (as some soccer coaches teach), the middle of the goal, or some other target? To answer these questions, *Chance* (Fall 2009) utilized the normal probability distribution. Suppose the accuracy $x$ of a professional soccer player's shots follows a normal distribution with a mean of zero feet and a standard deviation of 3 feet. (For example, if the player hits the target, $x=0$; if they miss 2 feet to the right, $x=2$; and if they miss 1 foot to the left, $x=-1$.) A regulation soccer goal is 24 feet wide. Assume that a goalkeeper will stop (save) all shots within 9 feet of where they are standing; all other shots on goal will score. Consider a goalkeeper who stands in the middle of the goal. Visualise the following probabilities and calculate **using Python**.\n",
