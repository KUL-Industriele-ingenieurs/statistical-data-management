    "1. Run the code below. A uniform distribution is defined, and 1000 samples of size ``n = 1`` are drawn. Then, the means of these size 1 samples (i.e., these values themselves in this case!) are collected in the list ``means``. Then a histogramme of these is generated. This closely resembles the probability distribution of the uniform distribution, which is to be expected.\n",
    "2. Set ``n = 2`` and re-run. Now, 1000 samples of size 2 are drawn and the sample means recalculated. The histogramme tends to resemble a normal curve, the central limit theorem in action. \n",
    "3. Uncomment another distribution. Rerun the code with ``n = 2``. Because (unlike the uniform distribution) these are asymmetric, a sample size of 2 is not sufficient to see the effect of the CLT. Increase the sample size to see the effect. Note the smaller range of the histogramme categories, because the sample mean follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation divided by $\\sqrt{n}$."
