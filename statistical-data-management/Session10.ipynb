    "The *Journal of Sport Behaviour* (2001) conducted a study of variety in exercise workouts. One group of 40 people varied their exercise routine in workouts, while a second group of 40 exercisers had no set schedule or regulations for their workouts. By the end of the study, 15 people had dropped out of the first exercise group and 23 had dropped out of the second group.\n",

    "3. Give a practical interpretation of the confidence interval you found in part 2.\n",
    "4. Suppose you want to estimate the true difference in dropout rates to within 0.1, with the 90% confidence interval. Determine the number of exercisers to be sampled from each group in order to obtain such an estimate. Assume equal sample sizes, and use the estimate from earlier, i.e. assume $p_1 \\approx \\hat{p_1}$ and $p_2 \\approx \\hat{p_2}$."
