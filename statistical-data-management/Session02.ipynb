    "The former considers observations \"too far removed from the mean\" (usually 3 standard deviations removed from the mean, in either direction) as outliers. Write code that creates a new column `z_score_kms` to calculate the z-scores of all car kms, and find outliers this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter considers observations either (1) less than the first quartile - 1.5*IQR or (2) more than the third quartile + 1.5 IQR, as outliers, with IQR the inter-quartile range, i.e. (75%-quantile - 25%-quantile).
