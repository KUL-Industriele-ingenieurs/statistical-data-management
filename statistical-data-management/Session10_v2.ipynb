    "The *Journal of Sport Behaviour* (2001) conducted a study of variety in exercise workouts. One group of 40 people varied their exercise routine in workouts, while a second group of 40 exercisers had no set schedule or regulations for their workouts. By the end of the study, 15 people had dropped out of the first exercise group and 23 had dropped out of the second group.\n",

    "## 3. Compare Argument Skills *(ex. 9.23 from the book)*\n",
    "Educators frequently lament weaknesses in student’s oral and written arguments. In *Thinking and Reasoning* (April 2007), researchers at Columbia University conducted a series of studies to assess the cognitive skills required for successful arguments. One study focused on whether students would choose to argue by weakening the opposing position or by strengthening the favored position. (For example, suppose you are told you would do better at basketball than soccer, but you like soccer. An argument that weakens the opposing position is \"You need to be tall to play basketball.\" An argument that strengthens the favored position is \"With practice, I can become really good at soccer.\") A sample of 52 graduate students in psychology was equally divided into two groups. Group 1 was presented with 10 items such that the argument always attempts to strengthen the favored position. Group 2 was presented with the same 10 items, but this time the argument always attempts to weaken the nonfavored position. Each student then rated the 10 arguments on a 5-point scale from very weak (1) to very strong (5). The variable of interest was the sum of the 10 item scores, called the total rating. Summary statistics for the data are shown in the accompanying table. You may assume both total ratings follow a normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Chance* (Fall 2002) described a lawsuit charging Intel Corp. with infringing on a patent for an invention used in the automatic manufacture of computer chips. In response, Intel accused the inventor of adding material to his patent notebook after the patent was witnessed and granted. The case rested on whether a patent witness's signature was written on top of or under key text in the notebook. Intel hired a physicist who used an X-ray beam to measure the relative concentrations of certain elements (e.g., nickel, zinc, potassium) at several spots on the notebook page. The zinc measurements for three notebook locations (on a text line, on a witness line, and on the intersection of the witness and text line) are provided in the following table. You may assume that measurements are drawn from a normal distribution.\n",
